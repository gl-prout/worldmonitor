### LinkedIn Launch Post
```
Excited to announce the biggest World Monitor update yet.

For months, I've been building an open-source intelligence platform that aggregates 80+ global news feeds, military tracking data, and infrastructure maps into a single view.

Today's launch adds:

🎯 Country Instability Index — Composite risk scores with 7-day trends
🚨 Geographic Convergence — Detects when multiple signals point to the same region
⏰ Temporal Anomaly Detection — Flags unusual activity vs historical norms
📱 Shareable "Stories" — One-tap generation of intelligence snapshots

The goal: Make world-class geopolitical intelligence accessible to everyone.

Huge thanks to the open-source community for the feedback and contributions.

Title: World Monitor — Open-source geopolitical intelligence dashboard (I built this)

Hey r/cybersecurity,

I've been building an open-source intelligence platform for the past few months and just pushed a major update.

**What it does:**
- Aggregates 80+ RSS feeds (defense, energy, tech, government)
- Tracks military flights, naval vessels, infrastructure
- Shows real-time instability scores for 190+ countries
- Detects "convergence" when multiple signals point to the same region

**What's new today:**
- Country Instability Index 2.0 with trend detection
- Temporal anomaly detection (spot unusual activity)
- Shareable "Stories" for intelligence snapshots

**Why I built it:**
Commercial OSINT tools cost $10K+/year. I wanted something free and open that anyone could use.

Demo: https://worldmonitor.app
Code: https://github.com/koala73/worldmonitor

### Reddit Post - r/INTELLIGENCE
```
Title: Built an open-source geopolitical intelligence platform (free, no API keys)

Hey r/INTELLIGENCE,

After years of working in the intelligence community (not naming names), I got tired of:
- Paying $15K/year for commercial OSINT tools
- Manually checking 50+ sources every morning
- Missing things because data wasn't correlated

So I built World Monitor:

**Features:**
- 80+ curated news feeds (government, defense, think tanks)
- Military tracking (ADS-B flights, AIS vessels)
- Country Instability Index with component breakdown
- Convergence detection (protests + military + news in same region)
- Temporal anomaly detection (unusual for this time of year)
- Shareable intelligence "stories"

**Data Sources:**
- ACLED/GDELT (protests, conflicts)
- OpenSky Network (military flights)
- MarineTraffic (vessels)
- Polymarket (prediction markets)
- 80+ RSS feeds

Free. Open source. No API keys required (some features need free accounts).

This is version 2.0 — been working on it for 6 months. Would love feedback from the community.

### Reddit Post - r/geopolitics
```
Title: Created a free tool that tracks global instability in real-time

r/geopolitics,

I've built an open-source tool that aggregates geopolitical signals into a single dashboard:

**What it tracks:**
- Protests and social unrest (ACLED)
- Military activity (flights + vessels)
- News velocity and sentiment
- Prediction markets as leading indicators
- Infrastructure (cables, pipelines, ports)

**Key metrics:**
- Country Instability Index (0-100)
- Convergence alerts (when multiple signals cluster)
- Temporal anomalies (unusual activity)
- 7-day trend lines

**Why:**
I wanted something that could answer "what's happening right now that matters?" without checking 50 different sources.

Free at: https://worldmonitor.app
Open source: https://github.com/koala73/worldmonitor

Try the "Stories" feature — generates shareable intelligence snapshots.

### Reddit Post - r/technology
```
Title: [Launch] World Monitor — Open-source global intelligence dashboard

I've been building World Monitor for the past year as a side project. The goal was to make high-quality geopolitical intelligence accessible without enterprise budgets.

**What it does:**
- Aggregates 80+ RSS feeds from government, defense, and news sources
- Tracks military movements (flights, vessels) in real-time
- Calculates country instability scores using multi-signal correlation
- Detects when multiple data sources converge on the same region
- Generates shareable "stories" for intelligence briefings

**Tech stack:**
- TypeScript + Vite (frontend)
- deck.gl + MapLibre (maps)
- Groq Llama 3.1 (AI summarization)
- Redis caching (Upstash)
- Vercel Edge Functions

**Why open source:**
Commercial intelligence tools are expensive ($10K+/year). This is free because I believe information should be accessible.

Try it: https://worldmonitor.app
Code: https://github.com/koala73/worldmonitor

Built by me (ex-intelligence community). Would love your feedback.
